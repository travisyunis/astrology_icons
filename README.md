### General Usage

#### Using The SVG Icons

SVGs are cool and they're the way to display icons on the web. Since they are just basic SVGs, we suggest you display them like you would any other image (don't forget the `alt` attribute). You may also download them to modify within your favorite vector image editor.

```
<img src="/icons/svg/icon-name.svg" alt="icon name">
```

Sizing icons only needs basic CSS. All the icons are in a square format, so just set the `<svg>` tag with equal width and height dimensions.

```
.icon {
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
}
```
